# PKs New Tab Redirect

Google Chrome extension that allows you to set a custom URL to the new tab page. The newtab
page can be redirected to the specified page or loaded within an iframe for a cleaner omnibar
if the resulting server supports it. You can also design your own local html file and use
that as the newtab page using a URL starting with file://.

This does not replace your homepage, only new tabs.
